**Overview**

This repository contains the dissertation project "**Integration of AI in Higher Education: Learner’s Perspective**", completed as part of a Master’s degree in Business Analytics at the University of Surrey (2024). The research investigates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) impacts teaching, learning, and student performance, with a special focus on ChatGPT/Abot adoption. The project explores both opportunities and challenges of AI in education, combining survey responses from 200 participants and sentiment analysis of 558 YouTube comments. A variety of machine learning models were applied to analyze perceptions, trends, and learner experiences with AI tools.

**Objectives**
1. Evaluate the influence of AI on higher education from a learner’s perspective.
2. Compare survey responses with public sentiment on YouTube to identify trends.
3. Analyze key factors affecting perceptions of AI in education (e.g., anthropomorphism, effectiveness, ethics).
4. Assess whether AI tools improve learning pace, quality, and student productivity.

**Methodology**
1. Mixed-method approach: survey (200 respondents) + YouTube sentiment analysis (558 comments).
2. Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.
3. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud.
4. Key Tasks: text preprocessing, sentiment classification, model performance evaluation, visualization.

**Key Findings**
1. Majority of students and teachers express positive perceptions towards AI in education.
2. AI improves study habits, material access, and personalized learning experiences.
3. Concerns include over-reliance, ethical issues, and potential job replacement.
4. Models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM achieved ~70% accuracy in sentiment prediction.

**Future Scope**
1. Deeper exploration of AI ethics and policy in education.
2. Expansion of datasets across different regions and cultures.
3. Development of AI-powered educational tools based on findings.
